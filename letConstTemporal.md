# Let Const Temporal Dead Zone 
## Difference between let and var.
- Well, var can be re-declared but let can't. And `let` introduced in javasript so that it can only used in the scope whereas `var` can be accesed anywhere into the immediate function.
## Let and Const use Hoisting??
- The answer is yes. But the hoisting happend in temporal dead zone, which is the time betweeen declaration and initialization.
